## What is Nextcloud?

Nextcloud is a self-hosted productivity platform that offers secure file sharing, collaboration, and cloud storage. It empowers users to retain control over their data while providing features comparable to popular cloud services. Nextcloudâ€™s flexibility can be expanded with popular add-ons such as:

- **Calendar** for scheduling
- **Contacts** for managing personal and shared contacts
- **Deck** for project management
- **OnlyOffice/Collabora Online** for real-time document editing
- **Talk** for secure video calls and chat

You can check out the [Nextcloud App Store](https://apps.nextcloud.com) for all extention apps.

With its rich ecosystem, Nextcloud is ideal for both personal use and enterprise-level deployment.

## How It Works

The platform uses the following components:

- **Nextcloud and Cron**: Core functionality and background tasks
- **PostgreSQL**: Database for administrative data storage.
- **Redis**: Caching backend.
- **Nginx-proxy**: Automated Nginx reverse proxy.
- **Omgwtfssl**: Self-signed SSL certificate generator.
- **Letsencrypt-companion** - Automated creation, renewal and use of SSL Let's Encrypt certificates.

> [!NOTE]
> You can use either Omgwtfssl (for self-signed local HTTPS) or Letsencrypt-companion (for Let's Encrypt secured HTTPS). The latter requires a configured domain.

## Bringing Code onto Your Host

1. Ensure you have Git or another tool to clone repositories. [Download Git here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
2. Clone the `nextcloud` code to your host:
   - Prepare a directory for the code.
   - Open a terminal in this directory.
   - Run the clone command:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/androg9n/nextcloud.git
     ```
   - Navigate into the directory with the cloned code:
     ```bash
     cd nextcloud
     ```
## Configuration (Optional)

The default configuration is workable and assumes local use with a self-signed certificate for local `cloud.home` domain.

> [!NOTE]
> The only you have to configure for succesfull starting is domain resolving from all host you want to have access Nextcloud server.
> It can be solved by Domain name hosting provider config, local DNS config, or even by editing `/etc/hosts` (for local solution).

Feel free to open variables file `docker-compose/.env` with your favorite text editor. Here you can configure:
- **Nextcloud image version**
- **PostgreSQL image version**
- **Domain hostname**

For switch between Self-signed and Let's Encrypt SSL/TLS enable only one service Omgwtfssl or Letsencrypt-companion in `docker-compose/compose.yaml` file.

## Prerquisites

1. Ensure Docker Compose is installed on your host. [Installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

## Starting

1. Open a terminal in the `nextcloud` code directory.
2. Navigate to the `docker-compose` directory:
   ```bash
   cd docker-compose 
   ```
3. Start the services with the command: `docker compose up -d`.
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```
4. Open Nextcloud in your web browser using the configured domain address (default [https://cloud.home](https://cloud.home)).
5. If you use a self-signed certificate, you will need to accept the security warning the first time you open the page.

## Stopping and removing

1. To stop the services, run from the `docker-compose` directory:
   ```bash
   docker compose down
   ```
2. To delete all collected service data, run from the same directory (be carefull!!! all data will be lost!!!):
> [!WARNING]
> this will permanently delete all data!
   ```bash
   docker compose down -v
   ```
